                    Hello! I am Isabel Vasquez from Peru, and I am a Web Developer and Programmer with 3 years of commercial experience creating successful websites in HTML, using CSS and making different projects in Python. 1 year ago, I finished Pathway Worldwide program where I learned a lot about Python programming and developed different skills that allow me to continue developing professionally. I am currently studying at Brigham Young University â€“ Idaho where I am constantly learning and updating myself on website creation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am also a Graphic Designer with 7 years of experience with knowledge in Photoshop, Illustrator and Corel Draw. I have created different logos, advertisements, brochures, flyers for many people and companies. As a graphic designer, I am sure that creating an attractive design will help capture the attention of the potential client and therefore help more people visit your website and consume your product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I work to make a better website; one that is fast, easy to use, beautiful, accessible to everyone, and frustration-free. Regardless of the specific business requirements, by solving challenges, there is a great chance of success online. Producing a modern website requires the combination of design, server technology and the layer that users interact with, I believe that having experience in both design and development allows for creating the most optimal user experiences. I really love creating and while doing this I enjoy helping other people or companies grow through my work.
