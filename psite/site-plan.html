        Successful Web Developer and Graphic Designer<br><br>
        Hello! I am Isabel Vasquez from Peru, and I am a Web Developer and Programmer with 3 years of commercial experience creating successful websites in HTML, using CSS and making different projects in Python. 1 year ago, I finished Pathway Worldwide program where I learned a lot about Python programming and developed different skills that allow me to continue developing professionally. I am currently studying at Brigham Young University â€“ Idaho where I am constantly learning and updating myself on website creation.<br>
        <br>
        I am also a Graphic Designer with 7 years of experience with knowledge in Photoshop, Illustrator and Corel Draw. I have created different logos, advertisements, brochures, flyers for many people and companies. As a graphic designer, I am sure that creating an attractive design will help capture the attention of the potential client and therefore help more people visit your website and consume your product.<br>
        <br>
        I work to make a better website; one that is fast, easy to use, beautiful, accessible to everyone, and frustration-free. Regardless of the specific business requirements, by solving challenges, there is a great chance of success online. Producing a modern website requires the combination of design, server technology and the layer that users interact with, I believe that having experience in both design and development allows for creating the most optimal user experiences. I really love creating and while doing this I enjoy helping other people or companies grow through my work

      <h3>Benefits page</h3>
      <p>
        Do you know about the benefits of having a website? Here I explain a little.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you know that more than 3.5 billion people are online every day searching for information or shopping on websites? And in fact, having a website would allow you not only to be part of this but also enjoy many benefits such as the following:
        <br><br>
        Credibility, which allows you to gain trust from your clients. In our digital age, not having a website for your business is grounds for suspicion and you will not be able to convert as many sales as you would if you had a more stable digital presence.
        <br><br>
        Increasing your presence on the Internet, with which you can be connected 24 hours a day. This will allow most people to access your website at any time. The web makes it quite easy to spread information about your business, transcend local borders, and expand nationally or even internationally. This visibility contains another great benefit, which is to gain market breadth. Furthermore, as I mentioned before, your website is your online showcase, your visible face on the Internet.
        <br><br>
        Improving your brand image, it is not only what will allow you to make a memorable impression on consumers, but it will also allow your customers to know what to expect from your company. It is a way to distinguish yourself from the competition and clarify what it is that you are offering that makes you the best option.
        Getting new clients or increasing your sales, both are great factors for making profits. Who among us wouldn't want to make more profits? A website provides businesses with the perfect platform to sell or promote their business goods or services. Customers can simply purchase or provide their preferred goods and services with a simple click.
        <br><br>
        These benefits are some of what you can get if you have a website, from gaining credibility to making more profits. And you, already have one?

      <h3>Work page</h3>
      <p>
        As a Web Developer and a Graphic Designer, I have been able to develop many projects. Feel free to take a look at my latest projects in the following lines.<br><br>
        I designed the front-end part of this website and participated in the back-end development stage. Together with a colleague we managed to develop this website for the DOIT Language Center, a company dedicated to teaching the English language and robotics for children, young people and adults.<br><br>
        I developed different systems in Python, a programming language widely used in web applications, software development, data science and machine learning (ML). Through which I could create different games. One of them is the word puzzle.
